## Objetive
Development of four algorithms in Java to sort elements of an array.

### Quick sort
The algorithm takes an array of values, chooses one of the values as the 'pivot' element, and moves the other values so that lower values are on the left of the pivot element, and higher values are on the right of it.

### Bubble sort
It is an algorithm that sorts an array from the lowest value to the highest value.

### Merge sort
The algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by first breaking it down into smaller arrays, and then building the array back together the correct way so that it is sorted.

### Heap sort
It is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap Data Structure. It can be seen as an optimization over selection sort where we first find the max (or min) element and swap it with the last (or first). We repeat the same process for the remaining elements. In Heap Sort, we use Binary Heap so that we can quickly find and move the max element in O(Log n) instead of O(n) and hence achieve the O(n Log n) time complexity.
