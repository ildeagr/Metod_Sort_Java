## Objetive
Development of four algorithms in Java to sort elements of an array.

### Quick sort
The algorithm takes an array of values, chooses one of the values as the 'pivot' element, and moves the other values so that lower values are on the left of the pivot element, and higher values are on the right of it.

### Bubble sort

### Merge sort
The algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by first breaking it down into smaller arrays, and then building the array back together the correct way so that it is sorted.
